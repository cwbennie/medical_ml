# Medical ML: PyTorch Experiments with MURA and CheXpert

This repository hosts several experiments leveraging PyTorch and other machine learning tools to improve the outcomes of classification tasks on large medical image datasets. Each dataset has its own directory for experimentation and source code.

## Directories

- [**mura_exp**](https://github.com/cwbennie/medical_ml/tree/main/mura_exp): This directory is designed for general experimentation with deep learning training methods. It offers insights into training optimization and methodologies to train models effectively.

- [**chex_exp**](https://github.com/cwbennie/medical_ml/tree/main/chex_exp): Similar to `mura_exp`, this directory focuses on experiments specifically with the CheXpert dataset, exploring different deep learning approaches and optimizations.

- [**moco**](https://github.com/cwbennie/medical_ml/tree/main/moco): Delves into the world of transfer learning, experimenting with Momentum Contrastive Learning to pre-train models that can be effectively utilized for novel downstream tasks.

## Overview

Each directory contains:
- **Source Code**: Actual scripts and modules used in the experiments.
- **Data**: Links to datasets or instructions on how to access them.
- **Documentation**: Detailed explanations of the experiments and findings.
